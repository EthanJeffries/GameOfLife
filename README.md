# GameOfLife

This application is the "Game of Life", which simulates the life of a bacteria over a period of time based on where bacteria cells are located in the simulation grid. The application uses JavaFX for the animation and front-end implementation, using "x" labels for the presence of bacteria and a grid whose size is determined by the user with TextField inputs.

This project is an assignment that I completed with groupmates for one of my classes at Elon University. I am responsible for the front-end design of the application, which is anything under the "view" package. This assignment's purpose was for us to implement the Model-View-Controller design scheme and we split the work up accordingly. This allowed us to practice dividing the work accordingly and communicating what we needed from each other in order for the application to work properly. We emphasized planning and communication throughout the entirety of the process in order to have clear expectations of each other, but also be able to adapt and shift our plan accordingly based on each others needs.
